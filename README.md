<h1>Car Price Analysis – EDA</h1>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>
The objective of this project is to analyze the factors influencing car prices using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
The dataset contains 205 records with 26 variables, covering car specifications, design features, and performance metrics.
</p>

<h2>Dataset Overview</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Rows:</strong> 205</li>
  <li><strong>Columns:</strong> 26</li>
  <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Manufacturer, Fuel type, Body type, Drive wheel, Engine size, Curb weight, Horsepower, Price</li>
</ul>

<h2>Tools Used</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Luxury brands (Buick, Porsche, BMW) have higher prices, while budget brands (Honda, Chevrolet, Dodge) dominate the affordable market.</li>
  <li>Engine size, curb weight, and horsepower are strongly correlated with car price.</li>
  <li>Convertibles and RWD cars are premium, while hatchbacks and FWD cars are budget-friendly.</li>
  <li>Diesel cars are generally priced higher than gas cars.</li>
  <li>Most cars fall in the $5,000–$12,000 range, with only a few premium models above $20,000.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>
Car prices are influenced by both brand value and technical specifications.
Affordable models dominate sales volume, while premium models contribute to higher margins and brand prestige.
These insights can help in pricing strategies, product positioning, and targeted marketing campaigns.
